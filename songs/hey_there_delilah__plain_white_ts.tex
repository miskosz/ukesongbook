\Intro\ \ch{D} \ch{F\#m} \ch{D} \ch{F\#m} \par

\bigskip

\ch{D} Hey there Delilah, what's it \ch{F\#m}like in New York City? \par
I'm a \ch{D}thousand miles away but girl to\ch{F\#m}night you look so pretty, \par
Yes you \ch{Bm}do \ch{G\beats2} Times Square can't \ch{A\beats2}shine as bright as \par
\ch{Bm}you... I swear it's \ch{A}true \par

\bigskip

\ch{D} Hey there Delilah, don't you \ch{F\#m}worry about the distance, \par
I'm right \ch{D}there if you get lonely, give this \ch{F\#m}song another listen, \par
close your \ch{Bm}eyes \ch{G\beats2}listen to my \ch{A\beats2}voice it's my \par
dis\ch{Bm}guise... I'm by your \ch{A\beats2}side \par

\bigskip

\begin{chorusbox}{\Chorus}
\ch{D}Oh it's what you do to \ch{Bm}me, \par
\ch{D}Oh it's what you do to \ch{Bm}me, \par
\ch{D}Oh it's what you do to \ch{Bm}me, \par
\ch{D}Oh it's what you do to \ch{Bm}me, what you  do to \ch{D}me \par
\end{chorusbox}

\bigskip

\ch{D} Hey there Delilah, I know \ch{F\#m}times are getting hard, \par
But just be\ch{D}lieve me girl some day I'll pay the \ch{F\#m}bills with this guitar \par
We'll have it \ch{Bm}good, \ch{G\beats2} we'll have the \ch{A\beats2}life we knew we \par
\ch{Bm}would... My word is \ch{A}good \par

\bigskip

\ch{D} Hey there Delilah, I've got \ch{F\#m}so much left to say, \par
If every \ch{D}simple song I wrote to you, would \ch{F\#m}take your breath away, \par
I'd write it \ch{Bm}all \ch{G\beats2}even more in \ch{A\beats2}love with me you'd \par
\ch{Bm}fall... We'd have it \ch{A}all \par

\bigskip

\Chorus

\bigskip

A \ch{G}thousand miles seems pretty far, but \ch{A}they've got planes and trains and cars, \par
I'd \ch{D}walk to you if I had no other \ch{Bm}way \par
Our \ch{G}friends would all make fun of us, and \ch{A}we'll just laugh along because  \par
we'd \ch{D}know that none of them have felt this \ch{Bm}way \par
De\ch{G}lilah I can promise you, that \ch{A}by the time that we get through, \par
The \ch{Bm}world will never ever be the \ch{Bm}same \par
And you're to \ch{A}blame \ch{A} \par

\bigskip

\ch{D} Hey there Delilah you be \ch{F\#m}good and don't you miss me, \par
Two more \ch{D}years and you'll be done with school, and \ch{F\#m}I'll be making history \par
like I \ch{Bm}do... \ch{G\beats2} You'll know it's \ch{A\beats2}all because of \par
\ch{Bm}you... \ch{G\beats2}We can do what\ch{A\beats2}ever we want \par
\ch{Bm}to... \ch{G\beats2} Hey there De\ch{A\beats2}lilah here's to \par
\ch{Bm}you, this oneâ€™s for \ch{A}you \par

\bigskip

\Chorus
