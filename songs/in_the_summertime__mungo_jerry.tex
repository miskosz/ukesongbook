\Intro \ch{C} \ch{C} | \ch{F} \ch{C} | \ch{G\beats2} \ch{F\beats2} \ch{C}

\bigskip

In the \ch{C}summertime, when the weather is high \par
You can \ch{C}stretch right up and touch the sky \par
When the \ch{F}weather's fine, you got women, you got women on your \ch{C}mind \par
Have a \ch{G\beats2}drink, have a drive, \ch{F\beats2}go out and see what you can \ch{C}find \par

\bigskip

If her \ch{C}daddy's rich, take her out for a meal \par
If her \ch{C}daddy's poor, just do what you feel \par
Speed a\ch{F}long the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty\ch{C}five \par
When the \ch{G\beats2}sun goes down, you can \ch{F\beats2}make it make it good in a lay-\ch{C}by \par

\bigskip

We're not \ch{C}bad people, we're not dirty, we're not mean \par
We love \ch{C}everybody but we do as we please \par
When the \ch{F}weather's fine, we go fishing or go sailing in the \ch{C}sea \par
We're always \ch{G\beats2}ha-ppy, life's for \ch{F\beats2}living, yeah, that's our philoso\ch{C}phy \par

\bigskip

Sing \ch{C}along with us, di di di-di-di \par
Da da \ch{C}da-da-da, yeah weâ€™re ha-pap-py \par
\ch{F}Da da da, di-da-du di-da-du di-da-\ch{C}da \par
Da da \ch{G\beats2}da-da-da \ch{F\beats2}da da da da-da-\ch{C}da \par

\bigskip


When the \ch{C}winter's here, yeah, it's party time \par
Bring a \ch{C}bottle, wear your bright clothes, it'll soon be summertime \par
And we'll \ch{F}sing again, we'll go driving or maybe we'll settle \ch{C}down \par
If she's \ch{G\beats2}rich, if she's nice, bring your \ch{F\beats2}friends and we'll all go into \ch{C}town \par

\bigskip

In the \ch{C}summertime, when the weather is high \par
You can \ch{C}stretch right up and touch the sky \par
When the \ch{F}weather's fine, you got women, you got women on your \ch{C}mind \par
Have a \ch{G\beats2}drink, have a drive \ch{F\beats2}go out and see what you can \ch{C}find \par
