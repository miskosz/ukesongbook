\note{play the first verse with tremolo} \par
\smallskip
At \ch{Am}first I was afraid I was \ch{Dm}petrified \par
Kept thinkin' \ch{G}I could never live without you \ch{C}by my side \par
But then I \ch{F}spent so many nights, thinkin' \ch{Dm6}how you did me wrong \par
And I grew \ch{E}strong, and I learned \ch{E7}how to get along \par

\bigskip

And so you're \ch{Am}back... from outer \ch{Dm}space \par
I just walked \ch{G}in to find you here with that sad \ch{C}look upon your face \par
I should have \ch{F}changed that stupid lock, I should have \ch{Dm6}made you leave your key \par
If I had \ch{E}known for just one second you'd be \ch{E7}back to bother me \par

\bigskip

\begin{chorusbox}{\PrechorusAndChorus}
Go on now \ch{Am}go, walk out the \ch{Dm}door \par
Just turn a\ch{G}round now, 'cause you're not \ch{C}welcome anymore \par
\ch{F} Weren't you the one who tried to \ch{Dm6}hurt me with goodbye \par
Did I \ch{E}crumble? Did you think I'd \ch{E7}lay down and die? \par

\bigskip

Oh no, not \ch{Am}I, I will sur\ch{Dm}vive \par
Oh as \ch{G}long as I know how to love I \ch{C}know I'll stay alive \par
I've got \ch{F}all my life to live, I've got \ch{Dm6}all my love to give \par
And I'll sur\ch{E}vive, I will sur\ch{E7}vive \par

\bigskip

Hey \ch{Am}hey \ch{Dm} | \ch{G} \ch{C} | \ch{F} \ch{Dm6} | \ch{E} \ch{E7} \par
\end{chorusbox}

\bigskip

It took \ch{Am}all the strength I had... not to \ch{Dm}fall apart \par
Kept trying' \ch{G}hard to mend the pieces of my \ch{C}broken heart \par
And I spent \ch{F}oh so many nights just feeling \ch{Dm6}sorry for myself \par
I used to \ch{E}cry, but now I \ch{E7}hold my head up high \par

\bigskip

And you see \ch{Am}me, somebody \ch{Dm}new \par
I'm not that \ch{G}chained up little person still in \ch{C}love with you \par
And so you \ch{F}felt like droppin' in and just ex\ch{Dm6}pect me to be free \par
Now I'm \ch{E}savin' all my lovin' for some\ch{E7}one who's lovin' me \par
