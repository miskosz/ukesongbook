\bigskip

\ch{Am} On a dark desert highway, \ch{E7} cool wind in my hair \par
\ch{G} Warm smell of colitas \ch{D} rising up through the air \par
\ch{F} Up ahead in the distance \ch{C} I saw a shimmering light \par
\ch{Dm} My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, \ch{E7} I had to stop for the night \par

\bigskip

\ch{Am} There she stood in the doorway, \ch{E7} I heard the mission bell \par
\ch{G} And I was thinking to myself this could be \ch{D}heaven or this could be hell \par
\ch{F} Then she lit up a candle \ch{C} and she showed me the way \par
\ch{Dm} There were voices down the corridor, \ch{E7} I thought I heard them say \par

\bigskip

\ch{F} Welcome to the Hotel Cali\ch{C}fornia \par
Such a \ch{E7}lovely place, \vocals{such a lovely place}, such a \ch{Am}lovely face \par
\ch{F}Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali\ch{C}fornia \par
Any \ch{Dm}time of year \vocals{any time of year} you can \ch{E7}find it here \par

\bigskip

\ch{Am} Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, \ch{E7} she got the Mercedes Benz \par
\ch{G} She got a lot of pretty pretty boys \ch{D} she calls friends \par
\ch{F} How they danced in the courtyard, \ch{C}sweet summer sweat \par
\ch{Dm} Some dance to remember, \ch{E7} some dance to forget \par

\bigskip

\ch{Am} So I called up the captain, \ch{E7} please bring me my wine \vocals{he said} \par
\ch{G} We haven't had that spirit here since \ch{D} 1969 \par
\ch{F} And still those voices are calling from \ch{C}far away \par
\ch{Dm} Wake you up in the middle of the night \ch{E7} just to hear them say... \par

\bigskip

\ch{F} Welcome to the Hotel Cali\ch{C}fornia. \par
Such a \ch{E7}lovely place, \vocals{such a lovely place}, such a \ch{Am}lovely face \par
They're \ch{F}livin' it up at the Hotel Cali\ch{C}fornia \par
What a \ch{Dm}nice surprise \vocals{what a nice surprise}, bring your \ch{E7}alibis \par

\bigskip

\ch{Am} Mirrors on the ceiling, \ch{E7} the pink champagne on ice \vocals{and she said} \par
\ch{G} We are all just prisoners here, \ch{D} of our own device \par
\ch{F} And in the master's chambers \ch{C} they gathered for the feast \par
\ch{Dm} They stab it with their steely knives but they \ch{E7}just can't kill the beast \par

\bigskip

\ch{Am} Last thing I remember, I was \ch{E7} running for the door \par
\ch{G} I had to find the passage back to the \ch{D}place I was before \par
\ch{F} "Relax" said the night man, we are \ch{C} programmed to receive \par
\ch{Dm} You can check out any time you like \ch{E7} but you can never leave... \par

\bigskip

\Outro\textbf{:} \par
\ch{Am} \ch{E7} \ch{G} \ch{D} \par
\ch{F} \ch{C} \ch{Dm} \ch{E7} \par
\ch{Am - single strum}
