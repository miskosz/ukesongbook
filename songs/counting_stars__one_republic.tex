\ch{Am}Lately, I've been, \ch{C}I've been losing sleep \par
\ch{G} Dreaming about the things that \ch{F}we could be \par
But \ch{Am}baby, I've been, \ch{C}I've been praying hard \par
\ch{G} Said, no more counting dollars, \ch{F}we'll be counting stars \par
\ch{F} Yeah we'll be counting  \par

\bigskip

\ch{Am}stars. \ch{C} \ch{G} \ch{F} \par

\bigskip

I see this \ch{Am}life like a swinging vine, \ch{C}swing my heart across the line \par
\ch{G}In my face is flashing signs, \ch{F} seek it out and ye shall find \par
\ch{Am}Old, but I'm not that old, \ch{C}young, but I'm not that bold \par
\ch{G}I don't think the world is sold, \ch{F} I'm just doing what we're told \par

\bigskip

\ch{Am} I-i-\ch{C}i feel something so \ch{G}right... doing the \ch{F}wrong thing \par
\ch{Am} I-i-\ch{C}i feel something so \ch{G}wrong... doing the \ch{F}right thing \par
\ch{F\rep2} I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie \par
\ch{F\rep2 - single strum}Everything that kills me makes me feel alive \par
