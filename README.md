A songbook for ukulele with Slovak, Czech and international songs.

## Generating songs.autogenerated.tex
We use python to create a tex file that imports all songs from a directory.
Follow these steps to set up your environment and generate the file:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv venv                     # Create a Python3 virtual environment named 'venv'
$ source venv/bin/activate                 # Activate the environment
$ pip install -r requirements.txt          # Install dependency packages
$ python generate_song_list.py -i songs    # Generate songs.autogenerated.tex
```
