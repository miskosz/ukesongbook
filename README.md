# ukesongbook
A songbook for ukulele with Slovak, Czech and international songs.

## Creating a PDF
Compile `main.tex` with `xelatex`. You might need to do it twice to properly
generate the table of contents (everyday joys of using TeX).

## Adding a song
Create a new file in the `songs` directory, use the same format as other files
in the folder. Then use the provided `generate_song_list.py` script to add the
song to the songbook, make sure your environment is set up properly (see below):

```shell
python generate_song_list.py -i songs    # Generates songs.autogenerated.tex
```

### Setting up python environment
First install the International Components for Unicode (ICU) C++ library, it is
needed for `PyICU` python package that provides localised string sorting. On MacOS,
you need to run roughly this:

```shell
$ # On MacOS
$ brew install icu4c
$ brew link icu4c --force                      # Tells you what to do
$ export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH  # Add to your .profile for repeated use
```

Follow these steps to set up your python virtual environment:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv venv                     # Create a Python3 virtual environment named 'venv'
$ source venv/bin/activate                 # Activate the environment
$ pip install -r requirements.txt          # Install dependency packages
$ python generate_song_list.py -i songs    # Now you can generate songs.autogenerated.tex
```
