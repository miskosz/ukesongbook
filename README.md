A songbook for ukulele with Slovak, Czech and international songs.

## Generating songs.autogenerated.tex
We use python to create a tex file that imports all songs from a directory.
Follow these steps to set up your environment and generate the file:

```shell
# Create a Python3 virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate the environment
$ source venv/bin/activate
# Install dependency packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Generate songs.autogenerated.tex
$ python generate_song_list.py -i songs
```
